# Landing project (OKKO/Fishka)
[DEMO link](https://v-vytrykush.github.io/OKKO-fishka/)

In this landing I used HTML, BEM, SCSS, Flex and other cool things.

Website is adjusting to screen size. All buttons are active.

To try this project by yourself:
1. Fork and clone [this](https://github.com/v-vytrykush/OKKO-fishka) repository.
2. Run "npm install" or "npm i" in your terminal inside the folder.
3. Run "npm start".
